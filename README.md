# CalendarApp
Calendar App for CSC690 Final Project


This project is for CSC690 and I will be implementing a basic Calendar App that displays the current month with the current day.

Proposed Plan: 

Must-Have Features:
-App must correctly display the current Month with the current year
-User should be able to skip through months.
-App must correctly display the given Month with its set of days and date
-User should not be able to go back to the previous months/years
-Landscape mode works as well

Nice-To-Have Features:
-User may see the current date by having the previous dates blacked out
-User may touch the upcoming and current dates with a small interaction
-However user should not be able to touch the past dates
-User can change the interface with a lighter tone for mornings, and a darker tone

I will use xcode with this project using xcode version number 9.3 and Swift Version 5
Most IOS devices are compatible with this application. I will be using the latest iphone, the iPhone Xr has my test device.
I shall also use my iPhone as a test for this application.
